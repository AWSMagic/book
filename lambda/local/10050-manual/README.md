# Manual Configuration

{% hint style="warning" %}
Manual Configuration section needs to be updated in order to reflect the changes done in the starter kit. This section should still work but won't produce the same outcome as the start kit.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
 If you used the "Starter Kit" then you can skip this section.
{% endhint %}

We will install required packages and create several files, manually.

Let's start.
