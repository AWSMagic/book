# Starter Kit or Manual?

Assuming that you have completed the prerequisites step, you have two paths to complete this tutorial.

## Use Starter Kit

* You are in a rush and want to have an environment quickly.
* You had done this before manually once
* You just don't care details
* You will forget these anyway, so what is the point of learning?

## Manual installation

* This is the first time you are doing this, you want to understand
* You have lots of time
* You want to validate if manual steps still work

## Decision

One of these paths is right for you. You are to decide which one.
